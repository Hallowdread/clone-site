# clone-site
A Simple Website I Tried Cloning Using HTML & CSS

I linked the original website screenshot on the site, its also in the folder

Didn't use any tutorials to clone this for the first time (it was really hard trust me)

Used other images in the HTML since i can't find the original

And unfortunately it isn't responsive so theres no mobile view...
